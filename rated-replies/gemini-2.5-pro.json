The soundtrack for OMORI is quite diverse and features contributions from several talented artists, but the *main* composers credited are:\n\n1.  **Pedro Silva (often credited as Slime Girls):** He composed a significant portion of the soundtrack, including many of the iconic battle themes and area music, particularly in HEADSPACE.\n2.  **Jami Lynne (often credited as Space Boyfriend's Tape):** She contributed several key tracks, often associated with specific characters or emotional moments.\n3.  **Bo en:** Known for composing some very memorable and distinct tracks in the game, most notably \"My Time.\"\n\nWhile these three are the most prominent composers, the game's creator, **OMOCAT**, also contributed some musical ideas and directed the overall sound design.

Before the OMORI *game* began development, OMOCAT was exploring the character and world through a webcomic/blog project on Tumblr.\n\nThe name of that blog was simply **omori**.\n\nIt started around 2011-2012 and featured illustrations, short comics, and writings about a depressed boy (described as a hikikomori) named Omori living in White Space.

This is the age Sunny was just before the traumatic incident involving Mari occurred.\n\nSo, although Sunny is 16 years old in the real world during the main events of the game, his dream avatar **OMORI perpetually appears to be around 12 years old** within Headspace, frozen at the age before everything changed.",

They don't age within the dream.\n3.  **Age Calculation:** HERO is three years older than SUNNY. When SUNNY was 12 (the age Headspace is based around), HERO would have been 15.\n\nSo, while HERO is 19 (turning 20) in the Real World during the present day of the game, his Dream World counterpart remains fixed at the age of 15, reflecting SUNNY's memories of happier times.",

At that time, SUNNY and his core friend group (AUBREY, KEL, HERO, BASIL) were younger.\n2.  **Age consistency:** All the main friends in HEADSPACE (OMORI, AUBREY, KEL, HERO) appear as their younger selves. Since the incident happened when they were around 12 (and SUNNY has been isolating himself for 4 years, making the real-world characters about 16), their HEADSPACE counterparts represent that pre-incident age.\n3.  **Appearance and Demeanor:** HEADSPACE AUBREY's bright design, cheerful (though sometimes temperamental) personality, and interactions fit the image of a pre-teen girl, contrasting sharply with her older, more jaded real-world self.\n\nSo, while her real-world counterpart is about 16 during the main events of the game, the AUBREY you interact with for most of your time in HEADSPACE is stuck perpetually around the age of 12.",

Their reconciliation is built more on confronting painful truths and shared history.\n\nFlowers are a very significant symbol in OMORI, but they are primarily linked to **BASIL** (his love for photography and gardening, the flower language meanings) and **MARI** (flowers on her grave, flower crowns).
