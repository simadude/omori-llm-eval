Omocat is also known for her artwork and clothing brand of the same name.

                    "reply": "In OMORI, during the \"ONE DAY LEFT\" segment, SUNNY attempts to save BASIL in a critical moment. After SUNNY returns home from the hospital, he receives a call from BASIL who sounds distressed. SUNNY then goes to BASIL's house at night and finds him in a severely troubled mental state.\n\nWhen SUNNY enters BASIL's room, he discovers BASIL experiencing a severe psychological breakdown, seeing \"Something\" behind SUNNY. This confrontation escalates into a physical struggle where BASIL attacks SUNNY with garden shears, resulting in SUNNY losing an eye.\n\nThis intense encounter represents the culmination of their shared trauma and guilt over MARI's death. The scene is pivotal to the game's narrative as it forces both characters to confront the truth they've been suppressing, and sets up the final decision point that leads to different endings of the game depending on player choices.",
