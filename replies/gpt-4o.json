                    "question": "What is the difference between the OMORI route and HIKIKOMORI route in the game OMORI?",
                    "expected_answer": "The name \"OMORI route\" and \"HIKIKOMORI route\" refer to the same route in the game OMORI, when you don\u2019t open the door to KEL on THREE DAYS LEFT.",
                    "reply": "In the game *OMORI*, the **OMORI route** and the **HIKIKOMORI route** are two distinct narrative paths that players can take, each offering a different perspective on the story and its characters. Here's a breakdown of the differences:\n\n### **OMORI Route (Sunny Route)**\n- This is considered the \"main\" or \"default\" route of the game.\n- In this route, Sunny (the real-world counterpart of Omori) chooses to reconnect with his friends in the real world (Kel, Aubrey, and Hero) during the last few days before he moves away.\n- The story alternates between the real world and the dream world (Headspace), with Sunny gradually confronting his past and the trauma surrounding the death of his sister, Mari.\n- The route focuses on themes of friendship, forgiveness, and healing as Sunny works to repair his relationships and face the truth about what happened to Mari.\n- The climax of this route involves Sunny confronting his inner guilt and fear, leading to a resolution that depends on the player's choices.\n\n### **HIKIKOMORI Route (Isolation Route)**\n- This route occurs if Sunny chooses to stay inside his house and avoid interacting with Kel when he knocks on the door on the first day.\n- By avoiding the real world, Sunny isolates himself and spends all his time in Headspace, the dream world created by his subconscious.\n- The HIKIKOMORI route delves deeper into the surreal and fantastical aspects of Headspace, with new areas, characters, and events that are not present in the OMORI route.\n- This route emphasizes escapism and avoidance, as Sunny refuses to confront his trauma or reconnect with his friends in the real world.\n- The story becomes darker and more unsettling, as Sunny's refusal to face reality leads to a lack of closure and a more ambiguous or tragic ending.\n\n### Key Differences:\n1. **Real World vs. Headspace Focus**:\n   - The OMORI route balances time between the real world and Headspace, while the HIKIKOMORI route focuses almost entirely on Headspace.\n   \n2. **Themes**:\n   - The OMORI route explores themes of healing, reconciliation, and facing the truth.\n   - The HIKIKOMORI route focuses on escapism, isolation, and the consequences of avoiding reality.\n\n3. **Content**:\n   - The HIKIKOMORI route includes unique areas, side quests, and events in Headspace that are not accessible in the OMORI route.\n   - The OMORI route includes real-world interactions and character development that are absent in the HIKIKOMORI route.\n\n4. **Endings**:\n   - The OMORI route leads to endings that revolve around Sunny's confrontation with his trauma and his relationships with his friends.\n   - The HIKIKOMORI route leads to endings that reflect Sunny's continued isolation and avoidance of his past.\n\nBoth routes offer unique insights into the game's story and characters, making them worth exploring for a full understanding of *OMORI*.",

Pay attention to the colors and the sequence.\n\n3. **Interact with the Crystals**: Go to each crystal in the correct order based on the hint. Interact with them by pressing the action button (default is \"Z\" or \"Enter\" on PC, or the confirm button on consoles).\n\n4. **Return to the Door**: Once you've activated the crystals in the correct order, the door will unlock, allowing you to proceed.\n\nIf you're stuck, double-check the hint near the door and ensure you're interacting with the crystals in the exact sequence.
